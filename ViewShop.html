    </h1>
    <h2 style="font-family: Californian FB;">The definition of vaping is the act of inhaling smoke-looking vapor from an electronic cigarette or vape device. Vaping simulates smoking but in a less harmful manner.A flavored nicotine liquid called vape juice (e-juice) is whatâ€™s in a vape,

     <h3 style="font-family: Californian FB;"> Vapes are handheld electronic devices for adults that produce inhalable fog-like vapor, often with nicotine and various flavors. The first retail vape was an electronic cigarette designed to look like a tobacco cigarette. Created by Hon Lik, the e-cigarette was released by the China-based company, Ruyan, in the early 2000s. Then to Europe and America around 2007. Now different types of vapes range in design, power, and vapor-making ability. The basics of their functions and usage are the same as the first one made.</h3>
